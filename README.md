# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run this application start by typing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/louis103/proximity-search-app.git
```

## Change into the folder by typing

```bash
cd proximity-search-app
```

## Then type the following to install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Once done, the next step is to launch the application

```bash
npm start
```

### This opens the application on port 3000

From there you can interact with the application and explore its features.
